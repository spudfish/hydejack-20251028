# Tal's Site Transfer and Update 2025

Developed by Kathy Cannon in October 2025, as follows:
* Editing problems with Wix made their service unusable
* Wanted paid-tier Weebly but Square support waning uncertainly
* ChatGPT search described the free tier in GitHub hosting
    * a goodwill service helping freelancers 
    * and supporting entry to paid services
* Agreed w client on Hydejack template with GitHub Pages tool
* Compared web contact email services:
    * chose Web3Forms over Formspree 
    * Has no-storage privacy policy
* Located domain registrar account at ASmallOrange
* Recommend registrar transfer by March 2026
    * found Porkbun for reputable small biz support
* Hydejack: Chose free template vs pro and found
    * Primarily blog-focused feature set
    * Pro tier pays for full documentation
    * ChatGPT offered code solutions with caveats
* Overcame development challenges with:
    * disabled/avoided blog feature set
    * initiated custom page layout
    * customized nav for single page layout
    * set up two work collection w yaml data
    * overlaid blue colors on b/w theme
    * recreated custom layout styles
    * re-styled publisher logos to blend in
    * inserted privacy-focused contact form

* Considered SiteLeaf for client editing but cannot trust
    * their initial entry caused unnotified unmarked disruption
    * they commited changes to my config file then
    * withdrew all identifiable traces next day

* Brought old-school 1999–2015 know-how in Dreamweaver from
    * only HTML5 and CSS without compilers or scripting 
    * into the compiler world of GitHub
    * THIS LEARNING CURVE WAS SO STEEP into Github
* Set up local copy of repository with abstracted workflow 
    * re-learned basic terminal commands (with Spouso help)
    * installed new project verdion Ruby from Homebrew
    * avoided install macOS command line tools
    * followed vaguely-understood AI help suggestions
* Edited with CotEditor, pushed commits with GutHhb Desktop
    * Put off Visual Studio w co-pilot workflow  
* Repository initiated from Hydejack Starter Kit
* Repository visibility set to public, GitHhb Pages enabled
* Functions built by Jekyll which uses:
	* Markdown content parsed by kramdown
	* Top-heavy Liquid templating of HTML
    * Sass driven css development, all for
    * DRY dont repeat yourself abstractions 
    * benefiting sprawling websites 
* But gained the functionality of a modern design
* Checkout the way the image splashes with 
    * a full cover image setting mood and menu
    * and slides off to the side for re-use
    * and reveals the home content while
    * responding to device sizes and 
    * switching device-toggled dark-light modes
